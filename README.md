this project was not completed due to the covid-19 pandemic 
# asm
this repo is for my assembler projects, it's likely this repo will eventually become unused and dead and 
at that point i'll probably just achieve it.
But until then im probably gonna write my coursework write up in in the readme as well as keep the code up to date
as since I can import code from other files yet (at least i don't know how) then everything is gonna be in the same file

## some info
im making a calculator, thats it

## how to run
assuming you have some basic knowledge terminal you can either:

### chad terminal version
First cd to the project directory, assuming you have alread extracted it if downloaded as a .zip
run this command just to check the syntax 

```
& 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Revolution Education\PICAXE Editor\Compilers\picaxe18m2_wjec.exe' -s '.\begining of project.bas'
```
change this link to the directory of where you have installed picaxe6, as far as im aware you can use the other compilers as im not using the built in wait functions in their version of MPASM

if it returns no erros then follow the follwoing instructions to get to work

```
fuck off im still doing the damn project
```



### peasant version

* open picaxe6 editor
* open the .bas file in the editor
* click simulate
* click program

if that doesn't work, google can be ur friend 

## write up
* [The current version of it is being written here](https://www.icloud.com/pages/04PooA6VNgQwprYUB_C_pMDpA#Electronics_courswork)
* Can't see it? copy-paste this link 
```

```

## other
- probably gonna write a vscode running thingy for this so you might not have to copy paste the thingy in to the thingy for much longer lmao :pog_champ: amiright
- i have done, you may download the repo, open the extracted folder in vs code and press ctrl+shift+b to test compile
